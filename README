Document your test cases with results and the interaction with Gradle from question 3 in the README in your repo (HTML or Markdown). That means there should be a detailed description of the steps in the test, the expected result, and which class/method implements the test. Note that the main goal is to have proper test-cases, so it is okay if in the end you have some test-cases that still fail, where you haven't been able to make them "green". In this case, a failing test-case can still serve as documentation.
